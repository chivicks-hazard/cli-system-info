# CLI System Info App

## Overview

This is another hobby project I have decided to build this year. What prompted me to do so is to create a form of convenience for myself. My taskbar was set to pop up each time my mouse went all the way to the bottom, but sometimes, due to heavy resource usage, my PC becomes slow, and when I try to move my mouse to that area, especially when I'm writing code, sometimes it hangs, other times the taskbar hangs, in some cases, the taskbar can crash altogether :sweat_smile:.

This project will be updated as time goes on. Hopefully, this doesn't enter the valley of unfinished projects :sweat_smile:
